      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <br>
      I go by Joe, a Computer Science undergrad at UC Davis. I got into CS in college because I was good at math in high school. Since then, I have been captivated by the limitless potential of the field, constantly exploring and learning how everything works. I learned C++ systematically at the university, and I picked up Python and Go through projects, along with Unix command lines through daily use. I am passionate about CS and always eager to learn!

              What is Lorem Ipsum?
              Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</div>
